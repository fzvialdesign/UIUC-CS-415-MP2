# UIUC CS 415 MP2   
Unreal Engine project that encapsulates a 5-10 min 3D platforming experience made for my second MP for CS 415 at UIUC

This Unreal Engine project was my final submission for the second machine project, the assignment being titled as "Level Design." This assignment was conducted over the course of about a month, split into two two-week intervals. The first week involved importing assets from the Unreal Learning Kit off of the Unreal Marketplace, building a health system, a collectible system, and an enemy that pursues a nearby player, dictated by an AI controller. The second week involved creating an enemy fixed to one location that shoots mortar projectiles that lock on to a player if nearby, my own unique enemy, player-enemy collision behaviors, and a final level layout designed to take 5-10 minutes to complete. Further details can be found in the Design Process PDF and the Submission Video. For this assignment, I received a grade of 100%, which can be seen in the Grade Screenshot.

Disclaimer: The final allowable submission date has long passed, so the ability to use this code to submit the assignment for a grade this current semester of Spring 2024 has similarly passed. I do not condone usage of this project for the purposes of cheating if this exact type of project assignment is to be re-used in future iterations of CS 415 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
